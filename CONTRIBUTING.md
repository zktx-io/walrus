# How to Contribute

## Important note

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We highly appreciate contributions, but **simple typo fixes (e.g., minor spelling errors,
> punctuation changes, or trivial rewording) will be ignored** unless they significantly improve
> clarity or fix a critical issue. If you are unsure whether your change is substantial enough,
> consider opening an issue first to discuss it.

If you want to make a substantial contribution, please first make sure a corresponding issue exists.
Then contact the Walrus maintainers through that issue to check if anyone is already working on this
and to discuss details and design choices before starting the actual implementation.

## GitHub flow

Before contributing, please read the [important note above](#important-note).

We generally follow the [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
in our project. In a nutshell, this requires the following steps to contribute:

1. [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects)
   (only required if you don't have write access to the repository).
1. [Create a feature branch](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow#create-a-branch).
1. [Make changes and create a
   commit](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-and-pushing-changes).
1. Push your changes to GitHub and [create a pull
   request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-a-pull-request)
   (PR); note that we enforce a particular style for the PR titles, see [below](#commit-messages).
1. Wait for maintainers to review your changes and, if necessary, revise your PR.
1. When all requirements are met, a reviewer or the PR author (if they have write permissions) can
   merge the PR.

## Commit messages

To ensure a consistent Git history (from which we can later easily generate changelogs
automatically), we always squash commits when merging a PR and enforce that all PR titles comply
with the [conventional-commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). For examples,
please take a look at our [commit history](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/commits/main).

## Documentation

Make sure all public structs, enums, functions, etc. are covered by docstrings. Additionally, if you
made any user-facing changes, please adjust our documentation under [docs/book](./docs/book/).

## Pre-commit hooks

We have CI jobs running for every PR to test and lint the repository. You can install Git pre-commit
hooks to ensure that these check pass even *before pushing your changes* to GitHub. To use this, the
following steps are required:

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
1. Install [nextest](https://nexte.st/).
1. [Install pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install) using `pip` or your OS's package manager.
1. Run `pre-commit install` in the repository.

After this setup, the code will be checked, reformatted, and tested whenever you create a Git commit.

You can also use a custom pre-commit configuration if you wish:

1. Create a file `.custom-pre-commit-config.yaml` (this is set to be ignored by Git).
1. Run `pre-commit install -c .custom-pre-commit-config.yaml`.

## Formatting

### Rust code formatting

We use a few unstable formatting options of Rustfmt. Unfortunately, these can only be used with a
stable toolchain when specified via the `--config` command-line option. This is done in
[CI](.github/workflows/code.yml) and in our [pre-commit hooks](.pre-commit-config.yaml) (see also
[above](#pre-commit-hooks)).

If your editor supports reading `rust-analyzer` preferences from `.vscode/settings.json`, you may want
to add the following configuration to that file to setup autoformatting. Note that this repo ignores
`.vscode/*` to allow you to further customize your workspace settings.

```json
{
  "rust-analyzer.rustfmt.extraArgs": [
    "--config",
    "group_imports=StdExternalCrate,imports_granularity=Crate,imports_layout=HorizontalVertical"
  ]
}
```

Also make sure you use the correct version of Rustfmt. See
[`rust-toolchain.toml`](rust-toolchain.toml) for the current version. This also impacts other checks,
for example Clippy.

### Move code formatting

We use the `@mysten/prettier-plugin-move` npm package to format Move code. If you're using VSCode,
you can install the [Move Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mysten.prettier-move)
extension. The formatter is also run automatically in the [pre-commit hooks](#pre-commit-hooks).

To use it as a stand-alone tool, we recommend installing it globally (requires NodeJS and npm):

```sh
npm i -g prettier @mysten/prettier-plugin-move
```

The Move formatter can then be run manually by executing:

```sh
prettier-move --write <path-to-move-file-or-folder>
```

## Tests

The majority of our code is covered by automatic unit and integration tests which you can run
through `cargo test` or `cargo nextest run` (requires [nextest](https://nexte.st/)).

Integration and end-to-end tests are excluded by default when running `cargo nextest` as they depend
on additional packages and take longer to run. These tests can either be run as follows:

```sh
cargo nextest run --run-ignored ignored-only # run *only* ignored tests
cargo nextest run --run-ignored all # run *all* tests
```

### External test cluster

Integration tests that require a running Sui test cluster can use an external cluster. This requires
a one-time setup:

```sh
CLUSTER_CONFIG_DIR="$PWD/target/sui-start"
mkdir "$CLUSTER_CONFIG_DIR"
sui genesis -f --with-faucet --working-dir "$CLUSTER_CONFIG_DIR"
```

For running tests, start the external cluster with `sui start`, set the environment variable
`SUI_TEST_CONFIG_DIR` to the configuration directory, and run the tests using `cargo test --
--ignored`:

```sh
CLUSTER_CONFIG_DIR="$PWD/target/sui-start"
SUI_CONFIG_DIR="$CLUSTER_CONFIG_DIR" sui start&
SUI_PID=$!
SUI_TEST_CONFIG_DIR="$CLUSTER_CONFIG_DIR" cargo test -- --ignored
```

This runs the tests with the newest contract version.

After the tests have completed, you can stop the cluster:

```sh
kill $SUI_PID
```

Note that it is currently not possible to use an external cluster with `cargo nextest`.

### Test coverage

We would like to cover as much code as possible with tests. Ideally you would add unit tests for all
code you contribute.

<!-- TODO(WAL-299) Add info about tarpaulin again as soon as the setup is fixed. -->

### Running a local Walrus testbed

In addition to publicly deployed Walrus systems, you can deploy a Walrus testbed on your local
machine for manual testing. All you need to do is run the script `scripts/local-testbed.sh`. See
`scripts/local-testbed.sh -h` for further usage information.

The script generates configuration that you can use when running the Walrus client and prints the
path to that configuration file.

In addition, one can spin up a local grafana instance to visualize the metrics collected by the
storage nodes. This can be done via `cd docker/grafana-local; docker compose up`. This should work
with the default storage node configuration.

Note that while the Walrus storage nodes of this testbed run on your local machine, the Sui devnet
is used by default to deploy and interact with the contracts. To run the testbed fully locally, simply
[start a local network with `sui start --with-faucet --force-regenesis`](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/local-network)
(requires `sui` to be v1.28.0 or higher) and specify `localnet` when starting the Walrus testbed.

### Simtests

We use simulation testing to ensure that the Walrus system keeps working under various failure
scenarios. The tests are in the `walrus-simtest` and `walrus-service` crates, with most of the
necessary plumbing primarily in `walrus-service`.

To run simulation tests, first install the `cargo simtest` tool:

```sh
./scripts/simtest/install.sh
```

You can then run all simtests with

```sh
cargo simtest
```

Further information about the simtest framework is available
[here](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-simulator#how-to-run-sim-tests).

## Benchmarks

We run micro-benchmarks for encoding, decoding, and authentication using
[Criterion.rs](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/criterion_rs.html). These benchmarks are
not run automatically in our pipeline as there is an [explicit advice against doing
this](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/faq.html#how-should-i-run-criterionrs-benchmarks-in-a-ci-pipeline).

You can run the benchmarks by calling `cargo bench` from the project's root directory. Criterion
will output some data to the command line and also generate HTML reports including plots; the root
file is located at [`target/criterion/report/index.html].

Criterion automatically compares the results from multiple runs. To check if your code changes
improve or worsen the performance, run the benchmarks first on the latest `main` branch and then
again with your code changes or explicitly set and use baselines with `--set-baseline` and
`--baseline`. See the [Criterion
documentation](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/user_guide/command_line_options.html#baselines)
for further details.

### Profiling

To get quick insights into where the program spends most of its time, you can use the [flamegraph
tool](https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph). After installing with `cargo install
flamegraph`, you can run binaries, tests, or benchmarks and produce SVG outputs. For example to
analyze the `blob_encoding` benchmark, you can run the following:

```sh
CARGO_PROFILE_BENCH_DEBUG=true cargo flamegraph --root --bench blob_encoding --open
```

See [the documentation](https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph) for further details and options.
