# Walrus General Terms of Services

Please read these Terms of Service (the “Terms”) and our Privacy Policy carefully because they
govern your use of the website, the user interface, and other offerings located at walrus.xyz, (the
“Site”) offered by Walrus Foundation (“Walrus Foundation,” “we,” “our”). To make these Terms easier
to read, the Site and our services (including Beta Services) are collectively called the
“Interface.” The Interface may facilitate interaction with the Walrus decentralized cryptographic
protocols, maintained by third party open source communities, which we do not own or control (the
“Protocol”) allowing for activities such as the creation of non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”), blockchain
games, DeFi apps, marketplaces, automated market makers, website hosting, data storage providers,
and wallets. BY USING THESE SERVICES, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE NOT A PERSON OR ENTITY WHO IS
RESIDENT IN, A CITIZEN OF, IS LOCATED IN, IS INCORPORATED IN, OR HAS A REGISTERED OFFICE IN ANY
RESTRICTED TERRITORY, AS DEFINED BELOW (ANY SUCH PERSON OR ENTITY FROM A RESTRICTED TERRITORY, ARE
REFERRED TO HEREIN AS A “RESTRICTED PERSON”).WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH
LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND WALRUS FOUNDATION THROUGH BINDING,
INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION 15 “DISPUTE RESOLUTION”
BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION WHERE
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES, THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IN SECTION 16 WILL NOT
APPLY TO YOU, BUT THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 15 (GOVERNING LAW) WILL APPLY INSTEAD.

1. Agreement to Terms

    By using our Interface, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by
    the Terms, do not use the Interface.

1. Privacy Policy

    Please review our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Interface, for information
    on how we collect, use and share your information.

1. Changes to these Terms or the Interface

    We may update the Terms, including any addendum terms, from time to time in our sole discretion.
    If we do, we’ll let you know by posting the updated Terms on the Site and/or may also send other
    communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we update them or you use the
    Interface. If you continue to use the Interface after we have posted updated Terms it means that
    you accept and agree to the changes. If you don’t agree to be bound by the changes, you may not
    use the Interface anymore. Because our Interface is evolving over time we may change or
    discontinue all or any part of the Interface, at any time and without notice, at our sole
    discretion.

1. Interface Use Eligibility

    a) Eligibility. The Interface is only available to users in certain jurisdictions that are at
    least 18 years old, capable of forming a binding contract with the Walrus Foundation and not
    otherwise barred from using the Interface as permitted under Applicable Law. You may not attempt
    to access or use the Interface if you are not permitted to do so.

    b) Compliance. You certify that you will comply with all Applicable Law when using the
    Interface. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your access and use of the Interface in
    such country, territory, or jurisdiction does not violate any applicable laws. You must not use
    any software or networking techniques, including use of a virtual private network (“VPN”) to
    circumvent or attempt to circumvent this prohibition. We reserve the right to monitor the
    locations from which our Interface is accessed. Furthermore, we reserve the right, at any time,
    in our sole discretion, to block access to the Interface, in whole or in part, from any
    geographic location, IP addresses, and unique device identifiers, or to any user who we believe
    is in breach of these Terms.

1. Use of the Interface

    a) User Representations and Warranties. As a condition to accessing or using the Interface, you
    represent and warrant to the Walrus Foundation the following:

    (i) if you are entering into these Terms as an individual, then you are of legal age in the
    jurisdiction in which you reside and you have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms and
    be bound by them and if you are entering into these Terms as an entity, then you must have the
    legal authority to accept these Terms on that entity’s behalf, in which case “you” (except as

    protocol, code, decree, or another directive, requirement, or guideline, published or in force
    that applies to or is otherwise intended to govern or regulate any person, property,
    transaction, activity, event or other matter, including any rule, order, judgment, directive or
    other requirement or guideline issued by any federal, provincial or state, municipal, local or
    other governmental, regulatory, judicial or administrative authority having jurisdiction over
    Walrus Foundation, you, the Site or the Interface, or as otherwise duly enacted, enforceable by
    law, the common law or equity (collectively, “Applicable Laws”); or (b) contribute to or
    facilitate any illegal activity.

    b) Limitations. As a condition to accessing or using the Interface or the Site, you acknowledge,
    understand, and agree to the following:

    (i) from time to time the Site and the Interface may be inaccessible or inoperable for any
    reason, including, without limitation: (a) equipment malfunctions; (b) periodic maintenance
    procedures or repairs that Walrus Foundation or any of its suppliers or contractors may
    undertake from time to time; (c) causes beyond Walrus Foundation’s control or that Walrus
    Foundation could not reasonably foresee; (d) disruptions and temporary or permanent
    unavailability of underlying blockchain infrastructure; or (e) unavailability of third-party
    service providers or external partners for any reason;

    Foundation the following:

    (i) you will comply with all Applicable Laws in connection with using the Interface, and you
    will not use the Site or the Interface if the laws of your country, or any other Applicable Law,
    prohibit you from doing so; and

    (ii) in addition to complying with all restrictions, prohibitions, and other provisions of these
    Terms, you will ensure that, at all times, all information that you provide through the

    confidentiality of your private keys associated with your public wallet address, passwords, API
    keys, private keys associated with your Interface account and other related credentials.

    d) Tax Records and Reporting. You are solely responsible for all costs incurred by you in using
    the Interface, and for determining, collecting, reporting, and paying all applicable Taxes that
    you may be required by law to collect and remit to any governmental or regulatory agencies.  As
    used herein, “Taxes” means the taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, and other charges imposed by any
    federal, state, multinational or local governmental or regulatory authority. We reserve the
    right to report any activity occurring using the Interface to relevant tax authorities as
    required under Applicable Law. You are solely responsible for maintaining all relevant Tax
    records and complying with any reporting requirements you may have as related to our Interface.
    You are further solely responsible for independently maintaining the accuracy of any record
    submitted to any tax authority including any information derived from the Interface.

    e) Costs and Fees. Each party shall be responsible for all Taxes imposed on its income or
    property. In addition, you agree to pay any applicable fees, including Gas Fees and hosting
    fees, in connection with transactions on the Interface. “Gas Fees” mean the fees that fund the
    network of computers that run the decentralized blockchain network, meaning that you will need
    to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the blockchain network.

    f) Suspensions or Terminations. In addition to the other suspension and termination rights in
    these Terms, we may suspend or terminate your access to the Interface at any time in connection
    with any transaction as required by Applicable Law, any governmental authority, or if we in our
    sole and reasonable discretion determine you are violating the terms of any third-party service
    provider or these Terms, including, without limitation, if we reasonably believe any of your
    representations and warranties may be untrue or inaccurate or you are violating or have violated
    any of the geographical restrictions that apply to the Interface, and we will not be liable to
    you for any losses or damages you may suffer as a result of or in connection with the Site or
    the Interface being inaccessible to you at any time or for any reason. Such suspension or
    termination shall not constitute a breach of these Terms by Walrus Foundation. In accordance
    with its anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-fraud, and other compliance policies and
    practices, we may impose limitations and controls on the ability of you or any beneficiary to
    utilize the Interface. Such limitations may include rejecting transaction requests, freezing
    funds, or otherwise restricting you from using the Interface, all to the extent of our ability
    to do so.

1. Beta Services

    a) We may offer some of the Services, including without limitation the testnet or devnet
    environments (“Testnet” and “Devnet”), in beta version (collectively, “Beta Services”). You
    acknowledge and agree that: (a) the Beta Services may not operate properly, be in final form or
    be fully functional; (b) the Beta Services may contain errors, design flaws or other problems;
    (c) it may not be possible to make the Beta Services fully functional; (d) the information
    obtained using the Beta Services may not be accurate; (e) use of the Beta Services may result in
    unexpected results, loss of data or communications, project delays or other unpredictable damage
    or loss; (f) we are under no obligation to release a live, commercial or public version of the

    b) In your use of the Testnet or Devnet, you may accumulate Testnet or Devnet tokens
    (collectively, “Beta Tokens”) such as through a faucet, which are not, and shall never convert
    to or accrue to become any other tokens or virtual assets outside of the respective Testnet or
    Devnet on which such Beta Tokens were issued. Beta Tokens are virtual items with no monetary
    value. Beta Tokens do not constitute any currency or property of any type and are not
    redeemable, refundable, or eligible for any fiat or virtual currency (including any rewards
    offered by Walrus Foundation) or anything else of value. Walrus Foundation does not guarantee
    that Beta Tokens will continue to be offered for a specific length of time and you may not rely
    upon the continued availability of any Beta Tokens. You acknowledge that you have no property
    interest in the Beta Tokens.  If the Beta Services expire, you acknowledge and agree that your
    access to and use of your Beta Tokens will be removed, and all accrued Beta Tokens will be
    deleted from the Beta Service environments. Beta Tokens are not transferable between users
    outside of the respective Testnet or Devnet on which such Beta Tokens were issued, and you may
    not attempt to sell, trade, or transfer any Tokens outside of that respective Testnet or Devnet,
    or obtain any manner of credit using any Beta Tokens. Any attempt to sell, trade, or transfer
    any Beta Tokens outside of the respective Testnet or Devnet will be null and void.

    communications with others), files, documents, graphics, images, music, software, code, audio
    and video. Anything (other than Feedback) that you post or otherwise make available through the
    Interface is referred to as “User Content.” Walrus Foundation does not claim any ownership
    rights in any Walrus Content and nothing in these Terms will be deemed to restrict any rights
    that you may have to your User Content.

    Interface you hereby grant to Walrus Foundation a non-exclusive, transferable, worldwide,

    us the license rights in your User Content under these Terms. You represent and warrant that
    neither your User Content, nor your use and provision of your User Content to be made available
    through the Interface, nor any use of your User Content by Walrus Foundation on or through the
    Interface will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual property rights,
    or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any Applicable Law or
    regulation.

    d) Removal of User Content. You can remove certain elements of your User Content by specifically
    deleting it. You should know that in certain instances, some of your User Content (such as posts
    or comments you make) may not be completely removed and copies of your User Content may continue
    to exist on the Interface. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not responsible or
    liable for the removal or deletion of (or the failure to remove or delete) any of your User
    Content.

    e) Walrus Foundation's Intellectual Property. We may make available through the Interface
    content that is subject to intellectual property rights. We retain all rights to that content.

    f) Feedback. We appreciate feedback, comments, ideas, proposals and suggestions for improvements
    to the Interface (“Feedback”). If you choose to submit Feedback, you agree that we are free to

    affiliates or service providers are responsible for determining the Taxes that apply to such
    transactions.

    A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could
    negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications, and could
    therefore also negatively impact the potential utility or value of User Content or certain
    digital assets. By accessing and using the Interface, you represent that you understand the
    inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you
    have a working knowledge of their usage and intricacies.

    You further understand that the markets for tokens and NFTs can be highly volatile due to
    factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and
    regulation.

    You acknowledge that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based
    systems are variable and may increase at any time. Accordingly, you understand and agree to
    assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using and interacting with the
    Interface.

1. Indemnity

    You will indemnify, defend (at Walrus Foundation’s option) and hold Walrus Foundation and its
    affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and
    against any claims, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, and costs and expenses,
    including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees arising out of or in any way
    connected with: (a) your access to or use of the Interface, (b) your User Content, or (c) your
    violation of these Terms. You may not settle or otherwise compromise any claim subject to this
    Section without Walrus Foundation’s prior written approval.

    SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER
    DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN
    CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE INTERFACE, WHETHER BASED
    ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY,
    AND WHETHER OR NOT WALRUS FOUNDATION OR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF
    ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WALRUS
    FOUNDATION’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF
    OR INABILITY TO USE THE INTERFACE EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).THE EXCLUSIONS AND
    LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN

    arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement,
    interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Interface (collectively, “Disputes”) will
    be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or
    consolidated action or proceeding. You and Walrus Foundation agree that the Cayman Islands
    Arbitration Law governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and
    Walrus Foundation are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class
    action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.

    b) Exceptions. The Parties retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a
    court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property
    rights.

    c) Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. These Terms will be governed by and construed
    in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands, without regard to or application of conflicts
    of law rules or principles.  Any dispute, controversy, difference or claim arising out of or
    relating to this Agreement, including the formation, interpretation, breach or termination
    thereof, including whether the claims asserted are arbitrable, will be referred to and finally
    resolved by binding arbitration to be administered by the Cayman Islands International Centre
    (CIAC) and governed by the Arbitration Act (as amended) of the Cayman Islands.  The arbitration
    shall be conducted in the English language and the place of arbitration shall be in the Cayman
    Islands.  The number of arbitrators shall be one.  The place of arbitration will be George Town,
    Cayman Islands.  The decision of the sole arbitrator to any such dispute, controversy,
    difference or claim shall be final and binding upon both parties.  If any litigation or
    arbitration is necessary to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party will be
    entitled to have their attorney fees paid by the other party.  Each party waives any right it
    may have to assert the doctrine of forum non conveniens, to assert that it is not subject to the
    jurisdiction of such arbitration or courts or to object to venue to the extent any proceeding is
    brought in accordance herewith. Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided in Section
    16(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim
    asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the
    individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by
    that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public
    injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of
    prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and
    extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in
    arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall
    be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.

    d) Class Action Waiver. YOU AND WALRUS FOUNDATION AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
    OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
    PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved
    through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your
    claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If
    this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute
    Resolution section shall be null and void.

    e) Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 16(d) of these Terms
    (“Class Action Waiver”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any
    part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still
    apply.
