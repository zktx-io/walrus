# Operating an aggregator or publisher
<!-- TODO (WAL-118): Add further details and example cache setup. -->

This page describes how you can run a Walrus aggregator or publisher exposing the [HTTP
API](../usage/web-api.md).

## Starting the daemon locally {#local-daemon}

You can run a local Walrus daemon through the `walrus` binary. There are three different commands:

- `walrus aggregator` starts an "aggregator" that offers an HTTP interface to read blobs from
  Walrus.
- `walrus publisher` starts a "publisher" that offers an HTTP interface to store blobs in Walrus.
- `walrus daemon` offers the combined functionality of an aggregator and publisher on the same
  address and port.

The aggregator does not perform any on-chain actions, and only requires specifying the address on
which it listens:

```sh
walrus aggregator --bind-address "127.0.0.1:31415"
```

The publisher and daemon perform on-chain actions and thus require a Sui Testnet wallet with
sufficient SUI and WAL balances. To enable handling many parallel requests without object
conflicts, they create internal sub-wallets since version 1.4.0, which are funded from the main
wallet. These sub-wallets are persisted in a directory specified with the `--sub-wallets-dir`
argument; any existing directory can be used. If it already contains sub-wallets, they will be
reused.

By default, 8 sub-wallets are created and funded. This can be changed with the `--n-clients`
argument. For simple local testing, 1 or 2 sub-wallets are usually sufficient.

For example, you can run a publisher with a single sub-wallet stored in the Walrus configuration
directory with the following command:

```sh
PUBLISHER_WALLETS_DIR=~/.config/walrus/publisher-wallets
mkdir -p "$PUBLISHER_WALLETS_DIR"
walrus publisher \
  --bind-address "127.0.0.1:31416" \
  --sub-wallets-dir "$PUBLISHER_WALLETS_DIR" \
  --n-clients 1
```

Replace `publisher` by `daemon` to run both an aggregator and publisher on the same address and
port.

```admonish warning
While the aggregator does not perform Sui on-chain actions, and therefore consumes no gas, the
publisher does perform actions on-chain and will consume both SUI and WAL tokens. It is therefore
important to ensure only authorized parties may access it, or other measures to manage gas costs,
especially in a future Mainnet deployment.
```

By default, PUT requests are limited to 10 MiB; you can increase this limit through the
`--max-body-size` option.

### Daemon metrics

Services by default export a metrics end-point accessible via `curl http://127.0.0.1:27182/metrics`.
It can be changed using the `--metrics-address <METRICS_ADDRESS>` CLI option.

### Sample systemd configuration

Below is an example of an aggregator node which hosts a HTTP endpoint that can be used
to fetch data from Walrus over the web.

The aggregator process is run via the `walrus` client binary as discussed above.
It can be run in many ways, one example being via a systemd service:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Walrus Aggregator

[Service]
User=walrus
Environment=RUST_BACKTRACE=1
Environment=RUST_LOG=info
ExecStart=/opt/walrus/bin/walrus --config /opt/walrus/config/client_config.yaml aggregator --bind-address 0.0.0.0:9000
Restart=always

LimitNOFILE=65536
```

## Publisher operation and configuration

We list here a few important details on how the publisher deals with funds and objects on Sui.

### Number of sub-wallets and upload concurrency

As mentioned above, the publisher uses sub-wallets to allow storing blobs in parallel. By default,
the publisher uses 8 sub-wallets, meaning it can handle 8 blob store HTTP requests concurrently.

In order to operate a high performance and concurrency publisher the following options may be of
interest.

- The `--n-clients <NUM>` option creates a number of separate wallets used to perform concurrent
  Sui chain operations. Increase this to allow more parallel uploads. Note that a higher number
  will require more SUI and WAL coins initially too, to be distributed to more wallets.

- The `--max-concurrent-requests <NUM>` determines how many concurrent requests can be handled
  including Sui operations (limited by number of clients) but also uploads. After this is exceeded
  more requests are queued up to the `--max-buffer-size <NUM>`, after which requests are rejected
  with a HTTP 429 code.

### SUI coin management in sub-wallets

Each of the sub-wallets requires funds to interact with the chain and purchase storage. For this
reason, a background process checks periodically if the sub-wallets have enough funds. In steady
state, each of the sub-wallets will have a balance of 0.5-1.0 SUI and WAL. The amount and triggers
for coin refills can be configured through CLI arguments.

To tweak how refills are handled you may use the `--refill-interval <REFILL_INTERVAL>`,
`--gas-refill-amount <GAS_REFILL_AMOUNT>`, `--wal-refill-amount <WAL_REFILL_AMOUNT>` and
`--sub-wallets-min-balance <SUB_WALLETS_MIN_BALANCE>` arguments.

### Lifecycle of created `Blob` on-chain objects

Each store operation in Walrus creates a `Blob` object on Sui. This blob object represents the
(partial) ownership over the associated data, and allows certain data management operations (e.g.,
in the case of deletable blobs).

When the publisher stores a blob on behalf of a client, the `Blob` object is initially owned by the
sub-wallet that stored the blob. Then, the following cases are possible, depending on the
configuration:

- If the client requests to store a blob and specifies the `send_object_to` query parameter (see
  [the relevant section](../usage/web-api.md#store) for examples),
  then the `Blob` object is transferred to the
  specified address. This is a way for clients to get back the created object for their data.
- If the `send_object_to` query parameter is not specified, two cases are possible:
  - By default the sub-wallet transfers the
    newly-created blob object to the main wallet, such that all these objects are kept there.
    This behavior can be changed by setting the `--burn-after-store` flag, and the blob object
    is then immediately deleted.
  - However, note that this flag *does not affect* the use of the `send_object_to` query parameter:
    Regardless of this flag's status, the publisher will send created objects to the address in
    the `send_object_to` query parameter, if it is specified in the PUT request.

### Advanced publisher uses

The setup and use of an "authenticated publisher" is covered in a [separate section](./auth-publisher.md).
