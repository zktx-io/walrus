# Publishing a Walrus Site

Now that everything is installed and configured, you should be able to start publishing your first
Walrus Site!

## Select the source material for the site

The `site-builder` works by uploading a directory of files produced by any web framework to Walrus
and adding the relevant metadata to Sui. This directory should have a file called `index.html` in
its root, which will be the entry point to the Walrus Site.

There is a very useful [example-Walrus-sites](https://github.com/MystenLabs/example-walrus-sites)
repository that contains multiple kinds of sites that you can use for reference.

For simplicity, we will start by publishing the most frugal of the sites, the `walrus-snake` game.

First, clone the repository of the examples:

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/MystenLabs/example-walrus-sites.git && cd example-walrus-sites
```

## Publish the site

Since we have placed the `walrus` and `site-builder` binaries and configuration in their default
locations, publishing the `./walrus-snake` site is as simple as calling the publishing command:

``` sh
site-builder publish ./walrus-snake --epochs 100
```

``` admonish tip
Depending on the network, the duration of an epoch may vary. Currently on Walrus Testnet, the
duration of an epoch is two days. On Mainnet, the duration of an epoch is two weeks.
```

The end of the output should look like the following:

``` txt

The site routes were modified

Created new site: test site
New site object ID: 0xe674c144119a37a0ed9cef26a962c3fdfbdbfd86a3b3db562ee81d5542a4eccf
To browse the site, you have the following options:
        1. Run a local portal, and browse the site through it: e.g. http://5qs1ypn4wn90d6mv7d7dkwvvl49hdrlpqulr11ngpykoifycwf.localhost:3000
           (more info: https://docs.wal.app/walrus-sites/portal.html#running-the-portal-locally)
        2. Use a third-party portal (e.g. wal.app), which will require a SuiNS name.
           First, buy a SuiNS name at suins.io (e.g. example-domain), then point it to the site object ID.
           Finally, browse it with: https://example-domain.wal.app
```

This output tells you that, for each file in the folder, a new Walrus blob was created, and the
respective blob ID. Further, it prints the object ID of the Walrus Site object on Sui (so you can
have a look in the explorer and use it to set the SuiNS name) and, finally, the URL at which you can
browse the site.

Note here that we are implicitly using the default `sites-config.yaml` as the config for the site
builder that we set up previously on the [installation section](./tutorial-install.html). The
configuration file is necessary to ensure that the `site-builder` knows the correct Sui package for
the Walrus Sites logic.

More details on the configuration of the `site-builder` can be found under the [advanced
configuration](./builder-config.md) section.

## Update the site

Let's say now you want to update the content of the site, for example by changing the title from
"eat all the blobs!" to "Glob all the Blobs!".

First, make this edit on in the `./walrus-snake/index.html` file.

Then, you can update the existing site by running the `update` command, providing the directory
where to find the updated files (still `./walrus-snake`) and the object ID of the existing site
(`0x407a3081...`):

``` sh
site-builder update --epochs 100 ./walrus-snake 0xe674c14...
```

The output this time should be:

``` txt
Execution completed
Resource operations performed:
  - deleted resource /index.html with blob ID LVLk9VSnBrEgQ2HJHAgU3p8IarKypQpfn38aSeUZzzE
  - created resource /index.html with blob ID pcZaosgEFtmP2d2IV3QdVhnUjajvQzY2ev8d9U_D5VY
The site routes were left unchanged

Site object ID: 0xe674c144119a37a0ed9cef26a962c3fdfbdbfd86a3b3db562ee81d5542a4eccf
To browse the site, you have the following options:
        1. Run a local portal, and browse the site through it: e.g. http://2ql9wtro4xf2x13pm9jjeyhhfj28okawz5hy453hkyfeholy6f.localhost:3000
           (more info: https://docs.wal.app/walrus-sites/portal.html#running-the-portal-locally)
        2. Use a third-party portal (e.g. wal.app), which will require a SuiNS name.
           First, buy a SuiNS name at suins.io (e.g. example-domain), then point it to the site object ID.
           Finally, browse it with: https://example-domain.wal.app
```

Compared to the `publish` action, we can see that now the only actions performed were to delete the
old `index.html`, and update it with the newer one.

Browsing to the provided URL should reflect the change. You've updated the site!

```admonish note
The wallet you are using must be the *owner* of the Walrus Site object to be able to update it.
```

```admonish danger title="Extending the expiration date of an existing site"
To extend the expiration date of a previously-stored site, use the `update` command with the
`--force` flag, and specify the number of additional epochs (from the current epoch) with the
`--epochs` flag.
```
